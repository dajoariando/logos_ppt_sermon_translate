You’ve heard of the saying, when the rubber meets the road, or When the push comes to shove… These statements implying that … yes, somethings may sound good in theory, but it’s another thing when you actually have to do it.

Like getting in shape, or loosing weight, or eating healthy, yes in theory, it's sounds good, but it's another thing when you actually have to do it."

You know faith can be like that.  It’s one thing to know all the Sunday school answers and have the Spiritual cliches, but it’s another thing when you encounter real situations in life and you have to actually live it out.

We’ve been going through the book of Acts, and today we see a story, where Sundays school answers fall short, and are insufficient. I entitled today’s message, Faith in Real Life.  Let’s see today, how to apply faith in Real life.

What that in mind, let’s look at today’s passage together:  Acts 12.  We are going to look at the entire chapter today, but because of time, we are just going to read from vs. 1-7

1 It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them. 2 He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword. 3 When he saw that this met with approval among the Jews,

he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread. 4 After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out

for public trial after the Passover. 5 So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him. 6 The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains,

and sentries stood guard at the entrance. 7 Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. “Quick, get up!” he said, and the chains fell off Peter’s wrists.

Some people have answers for everything, don’t they?  Every time something happens, they seem to have something cliché-ish to say, “Everything happens for a reason”. “God must know you can handle it.

"If you just pray hard enough, if you have enough faith then …

But you & I know that life in this fallen world, is not that simple.  Sometime life just doesn’t make sense and we just don’t understand what God is doing. The first thing I believe God wants us to see from today’s passage is this:  
#1. Realizing that at times there are no easy answers!

vs.1-3 It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them. He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword. When he saw that this met with approval among the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also.

Who is Herod? We know this name because it appears often in the Bible, but they are not the same person.

Facts on “King Herod”: Herod the Great: Killed baby boys (Mt. 2). One of his sons: Herod Antipas: Killed John the Baptist (Mt.14). Herod Agrippa: Killed James, imprisoned Peter (Acts 12)

Can you imagine living in that Biblical time, as a follower of Christ, under the reign of all these evil Kings?  Who knows how many lives have been taken? Talk about persecution, oppression, fear, uncertainty, where they often asked the questions, why Lord, when Lord? 

Who is James? Today’s passage tells us - the brother of John. Very often we see in the Bible, Peter, James & John, -  the 3 closest companions of Jesus. These 3 were there at the mount of transfiguration: where Jesus transformed into His glorious state.

“Peter, James & John” were there at the garden of Gethsemane with Jesus: where Jesus was so burdened to the point that he sweated blood.  He shared that intimate moment with – “Peter, James & John”

James, was not just a Christian, he was a devoted follower of Christ. He was not just a good Christian, he was a leader of the church. He was not just a leader, he was one of the 12.

He wasn’t one of the Apostles, he was one the 3, that were most intimate with Jesus. But James was arrested, taken away from God’s people, “a sword was taken out”, he was beheaded. What a tragic ending to his life.

In today’s passage we just read, there were two parts, part 1. we see James’ death. Part 2, Peter’s release.

If you were a Sunday School teacher or a Bible Study leader, you are to pick a portion from Acts Chapter 12 to teach from, which portion would you focus on?  Of course, Peter’s release.  Of course.  It makes sense!  

We want our lives to be characterized by part 2. - To be all about the Miraculous release of Peter.  (which we will touch on later), But the question remains, How do you explain James’ death? 

There is a story of soldiers returning home after the war, but this particular family was informed that their son didn’t make it.  They were totally heart broken. But when they went to the military base anyway, to see the soldiers coming home.    

And when they were, they couldn’t believe what they saw, they saw their son, alive & well.  And they found out that it was a mistake.  Because one of the soldiers that had killed, had the exact same name as their son. 

What are the chances of that?  And so in their excitement they cried out, God is good.     

Question: But how about the other family? who went there that day, fully anticipating to see their son, but instead received the death certificate. Just as people were praying for the release of Peter, I’m pretty sure they were praying for James as well.

The question remains, while God allowed Peter to be set free, why didn’t God set James free?  It’s irresponsible of me as your pastor, to simply address Peter’s release, and not James’ death.

Because very often in life, Real life, we are more familiar with James’ experience than Peter’s. Sometime we wonder, don’t we?  We try to use our limited human logic to make sense of these difficult circumstances …  

Let’s do that, let’s try to figure out …

A multiple choice question:  Why Peter not James?
(a) God was unable to save James.
(b) Peter had more faith than James.
(c) Peter was more important/indispensable/useful to God’s kingdom.
(d) God loved Peter more than James.
(e) None of the Above.

Can we be honest, we try to make sense of life, but the reality is that, a lot of times in life, real life, in this fallen world, there are simply no easy answers!  And we need to make peace with that. 

St. Augustine said, "A God whom I can fully understand is not a God I can truly trust." We need to be OK with the fact, that sometimes we don’t know what God is doing.  

What does Faith in Real life look like? #2. Relying on God when faith is weak.

Vs. 4-5 After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.

So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.

Do you see how careful King Herod was?  He was doing everything he could to not allow Peter to get away. “four squads of four soldiers” - 16 Roman soldiers guarding Peter.  talk about Maximum security.  

There’s no way, Peter’s getting out of here!  No one is able to get him out of there, except God.  And He did.  God answered their prayers…

Let me point out to you that they were really struggling with their faith, let me remind you that this was right after James’ execution.  Look at their reactions when God released Peter.

v. 12-14 he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying. 13 Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer the door.

14 When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, “Peter is at the door!”

Obviously they had locked the door, why because Herod was killing Christians and they were scared. In her joy, she didn’t open the gate, she didn’t even let him in…  

Here was Peter, just escaped from maximum prison, standing outside of the gate.  He’s probably thinking, the prison alarm is probably going to go off soon, and they will be searching for him, I wish someone would let me in… He’s knocking, 

While Rhoda runs inside the house… It’s Peter, It’s Peter. What did those “Faith-filled Christians who had been praying for Peter’s release tell her?

15 “You’re out of your mind,” they told her. “Are you crazy?  He’s in prison, get back here so we can pray for Him to be released.” When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, “It must be his angel.”

16 But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. 17 Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison.

Notice: While they were praying, they couldn’t believe that God would/could actually answer their prayers. Could it be that while they were praying, they really weren’t expecting God to answer?  They had little faith.  They had weak faith.

It reminds me of the story of the mother who was a devout believer, she had been going to the church to pray for rain.  It was a season of drought, and they were in desperate need of water.  

But on this particular day, she decided to take her little girl with her.  She thought it would be good for the girl to learn to pray.  As they were leaving the house, the little girl insisted on going back to the house to get something. 

The mother didn’t understand why? “What is it so important that you had forgotten to bring. She said, mother, we forgot to bring the umbrella.

This group of people, they were praying, but they weren’t expecting God to answer.  They had small/weak faith. But you know what?  I’m glad they were still praying. They still had faith, although it was a very small faith.

Isn’t it better to have a little faith in the true God, then to have massive amont of faith in a wrong God. Even they had little faith, they kept praying.  It would be easy for them to stop praying.  “We prayed for James, that didn’t work.  Why bother praying.   

They continued to pray.  “Earnestly”: fervently pleading, What is prayer?  Prayer is an act of dependence.  They were desperately crying out to God, “God if you don’t help us, no one can.  God we have nowhere else to turn.  God please intervene.”    

God loves it when pray, not out of obligation, but out of desperation.  Not out of rituals/routine, but out of a dependent heart. In this life, we are called to make a lot of decisions, Big decisions/little decisions. 

What school to go to, our direction in life, serving opportunities, career, relationships,…  Let’s be honest, at times it’s hard to tell which decision is the right decision, or the best decision.

While we don’t always know we’ve made the right/best decisions, I hope that one day when we look back in our lives, over all the decisions we’ve made, we will see lots of prayer.  We will see us relying on God every step of the way. 

At times when we don’t know what to do, the question is not what to do, but have I prayed…  because when we pray, we are acknowledging God for who He is. 

The Bible says, in Proverbs 3:5-6. 5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; 6 in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.

(NKJV) says And He shall direct your paths. That’s what we need! What’s faith in real life? #3. Trusting that God is ultimately in control.

21 On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. 22 They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.”

23 Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.

Do you see that?  This is King Herod, the powerful King Herod, whose entire family, for many generations had been persecuting God’s people, and God took him out, just like that…  

When Evil prevails, when things seem to be out of control, Sometimes, God reminds us, that wait, He is still in control. Look at these 2 stories, right after death of James.  

While God’s people were mourning for the loss of James, while they were probably trying to make sense of life, Peter was miraculously released from prison … 

17 Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison.  who released Peter?  God did ! In the midst of questions, political oppression, King Herod was suddenly struck down. 

23. because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down,

Who struck him down?  God did. Do you see what God’s doing?  God was reminding his people, even though times are dark/difficult, life seemed to be out of control, He’s still what?  In control.  

Look at how the Biblical Writer, Dr. Luke had chosen to end today’s story…  v. 24 But the word of God continued to spread and flourish. 25 When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark.

The book of Acts records the Mission of God.  The movement of God working, working in & through the lives of His people. Was everything rosy?  No! There was much suffering. Were there opposition?  Yes!  To the point of death.

But you know what?  God’s mission/purpose was being accomplished.  God was carrying out his sovereign plan.  His Plan of Salvation, Plan of redemption was being executed…  God was in control.

Today, if we could have a meeting with the 1st century believers, those who suffered, even gave their lives for God.  You know what they would say to us?   

“we know, … You may not be able to tell, you may not see God working but…  So hang in there, trust God, even in the midst of trials, suffering, remember, God is in control.  He’s in total control.  And carrying out his sovereign plan.  You can trust Him.

And that’s why Peter was able to have such peace as he awaited his “would be” execution. I want you to see how the Bible writer went into such detail in describing how Peter was able to sleep the night before his execution.  

v. 6 The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance.

7 Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. “Quick, get up!” he said, and the chains fell off Peter’s wrists.

His head was about to be cut off, but he was sleeping. He was sleeping so soundly, that the Angel of the Lord had to “strike”, the same word that was used when Peter Struck the solider by chopping off his ear, in the Garden of Gethsemane. 	 

The Angel said, get up, you sleepy head, you! I find it refreshing that in our world today, where people spend millions of dollars each year, buying sleep medications, 

But we see here in this passage, A man who had every reason to be stressed, to worry, to fear, could sleep so well under the circumstances.  How could Peter have such peace? 

Could it be that he had learned and believed in his heart of hearts, that there is a God, his God, who is in control, total control, of his life’s circumstance, and he had submitted himself to Him.  That’s trust ! 

How about you? Where are you in this process?  Is your life characterized by worries/anxieties/fear, the need have control over the details of your life, or peace, joy, rest. 

Many of you here in this room, are in the midst of difficult circumstances, you are struggling, you are waiting, you are wondering what / or if God’s going to come through…  

God wants to say to you, His children, His beloved children, He’s in control, He is.  And we can trust Him.  Even though, life is so hard, and there are no answers on this side of eternity, our heavenly Father, is sovereign and He is in total control.

May we be a people who not only praise God when we share Peter’s joy, but may we be a people, who will learn to still trust God, when we shed tears over James.  Amen.  

Now That’s Faith in Real life !
